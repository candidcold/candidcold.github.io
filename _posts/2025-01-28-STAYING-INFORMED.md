[In my last post](https://candidcold.github.io/2024/12/27/GETTING-INVOLVED-LOCALLY.html), I talked about how I got involved in politics locally. Part of that was recognizing that my desire to be informed about **everything** going on in national politics was a paralyzing “small power” that we should be breaking free from. Staying informed is still very important! Small power is still power. We should, however, focus that small power on what we want to achieve.

## Shaping your options

I saw this YouTube series talking about reasons to read, and this was one short video in the series: [you can only cook what's in the fridge // reasons to read](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S0krJtb8vxI). The premise is that your output (cooked meal) is dictated by your input (the ingredients in your fridge). Being informed about what’s going on in your topic is ingredient gathering, and it helps refine your vision of the future and how you’d like to shape your options. Without this ingredient gathering it is easy to fall into a way of thinking that makes you stick to the status quo. Pedestrianizing Times Square was not an obvious or easy thing to do at the time, but it was an ambitious idea rooted in the vision of what that space _should_ be. The work from there is to figure out the next viable step and the details of how to bring that vision of what you want to life.

Read books, listen to podcasts, and seek out more information. For the topic of transportation, some of those resources I found were:

- [Not Just Bikes](https://www.youtube.com/@NotJustBikes)
- [Streetsblog NYC](https://nyc.streetsblog.org/)
- [Streetfight: Handbook for an Urban Revolution by Janette Sadik-Khan](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/318945/streetfight-by-janette-sadik-khan-and-seth-solomonow/)

## Find out what’s going on around you

While I’m not arguing that local matters are more important than national matters, I do think that local news is more likely to cover things going on around you that you can get involved in. It can be a little difficult to find due to a decline in local journalism, but it is not complex! Much like advocacy groups, many small publications are starved for readers, and if you search for "state/city newspaper" you will find a few. You can see for yourself what their vibe is and decide if they’re right for you. I did this, and it led me to these publications:

- [Gothamist](https://gothamist.com/)
- [THE CITY - NYC News](https://www.thecity.nyc/)

Some of my personal tips for how to not sink back into the dread of information overload:

1. Sign up for newsletters if the source provides it. Some news sources provide recaps of the most important stories from a given time period. If something catches your eye you can then dive deeper. I love a weekly newsletter.
1. If you sign up to these newsletters with a Gmail alias (putting a + after your email, like **johndoe+newsletters@gmail.com**) you can easily set up a few Gmail filters to organize your inbox better at a glance. [Here’s more information about how to set up filters](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6579?hl=en).
1. If you don’t mind using another website/app, an RSS reader really helps to bring everything together. I personally use [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/)
   - In short, many websites produce RSS feeds that are updated whenever new content comes out. With an RSS reader you are essentially following websites, and whenever something new comes out it will bop to the top of your feed.
   - Fun fact: this is how most podcasts work; your podcast player is essentially an RSS “listener.” Podcasts, YouTube channels, Substack pages, and Wordpress sites all produce RSS feeds that you can follow!
1. Combining all of the prior steps, you can turn newsletters into RSS feeds, and have them show up in your RSS reader using a service like **Kill the Newsletter!**. [Here is a more in depth guide on how to do this](https://bryanmanio.com/blog/email-newsletters-to-rss/). As someone who doesn’t love email, this is exactly what I’ve been looking for.

## Paralyzing Pitfalls

Here are some pitfalls to avoid:

- You do not need to have read everything to get your head in the game; wanting to be more informed should not be something that paralyzes us.
- It can also be tempting to feel like you’ve discovered something and sit for too long in the superiority of knowing you’re right or that some others agree with you. Sitting in this is also a form of paralysis. The ultimate goal is to **act** and **organize**. Where can this apply for you?
- Go to group meetings and share with other real people who are trying to make change just as you are. Talking to real people is a way to stay meaningfully informed!
- Remember we’re all in this together. Don’t just be a contrarian. Don’t try to talk down to people. This shouldn't be about trying to show off how smart you are.
