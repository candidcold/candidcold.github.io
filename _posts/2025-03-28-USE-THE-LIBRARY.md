Use the library. Your taxes are already paying for the library. Using the library signals which resources (books, DVDs, etc.) they need to buy more of. If the library doesn’t have something, you can request that they buy it. Thus, using the library makes the library better for everyone.

## Getting your card(s)

If you live, work, attend school, or pay property taxes in New York State, you are eligible for **3 different library cards**. You can go in person to sign up for them, or if all you care about are digital items (like ebooks, audiobooks, etc.), you can get a digital card in minutes.

- [The New York Public Library](https://www.nypl.org/help/library-card)
- [Brooklyn Public Library](https://www.bklynlibrary.org/card/)
- [Queens Public Library](https://queenslibrary.org/get-a-card/eUser)

## Using your card(s)

If you’re close to a physical library location and want to check out physical materials, go to the library. Overwhelmed by the idea? Your library’s website probably has a catalog where you can look up what is available, and even request that it be reserved for you at your local location. I’ve been using this often lately to check out movies and TV shows on Blu-Ray from the Queens Public Library (they’ve got good recent stuff, like [Wicked](https://queenslibrary.org/blu-ray/Wicked-[Blu-ray]/1480592) and [Severance](https://queenslibrary.org/dvd/Severance.-Season-1-[DVD]/1475355)!)

What I do most of the time is make use of my library card digitally:

- Use [Libby](https://www.overdrive.com/apps/libby) to check out ebooks and audiobooks. This is a must, the app is amazing and available on most platforms. You can also easily send your ebooks to your e-reader. 10/10
- Check out [Kanopy](https://www.kanopy.com/en), a streaming service that uses your library card to watch movies for free. I use this every so often, and when it has something you want to watch it’s great. The options aren’t always plentiful, but it’s free.
- Check out [Hoopla](https://www.hoopladigital.com/), a combination of both of the above, but also includes tv shows and music. Jack of all trades. I don’t use this a ton, but you should know about it.

If the library doesn’t have what you want, you can also recommend that they order it! A few links:

## Library Extension

You’re using your libraries; life is good. Let’s make it better: download [Library Extension](https://www.libraryextension.com/) for your browser.

When you go onto a website like Goodreads or The Story Graph, you’ll get a helpful little popup telling you where that item is available given your various library cards. This is what mine looks like, for example:

_(There’s also a beta feature which will allow you to see this for other format types like Blu-Rays and DVDs, but I haven’t gotten it to work yet. The developer is working on it!)_

## E-reader setup

If you have a Kindle device, when checking out books on Libby you can send your ebooks to your Kindle.

If you have a Kobo device like I do, you can log into your library providers, and once you checkout an ebook from Libby, it will automagically appear on your Kobo. You can also directly check out books on your Kobo from the Overdrive digital library (where Libby checks books out from) if that floats your boat. Here's a [helpful guide](https://tedbrakob.medium.com/how-to-use-kobo-overdrive-integration-with-multiple-library-cards-f0c8055a4f4e) on how to set up your Kobo with multiple libraries.

So, use the library.
